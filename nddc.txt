## Why did you choose those goals (long and short)?

I chose these goals because the Niger Delta is experiencing increased digitalization but lacks adequate local capacity to secure its systems. My long-term goals are designed to address this gap by building local expertise and fostering a culture of digital safety. The short-term goals are practical steps to acquire the specialized knowledge, experience, and networks necessary to make a meaningful impact at home. Each goal is a response to specific needs I have observed in my community and is structured to deliver sustainable benefits.

## What do you do currently?

I am actively involved in software development projects and volunteer initiatives in Calabar. I work on digital tools for educational management, participate in community tech forums, and contribute to youth training programs. I also stay engaged with the latest developments in cybersecurity, preparing myself for graduate study and future leadership in the field.

## What’s the guarantee that you’ll pay this forward?

My record of community engagement demonstrates my commitment to giving back. I have led and participated in local training, fundraising, and outreach projects. I am bound by the NDDC’s return requirement, and I have already started discussions with local organizations interested in collaborating on digital security and skills development. My plan includes launching accessible training programs and mentorship initiatives to ensure that the knowledge and skills I gain are widely shared and have lasting impact in the Niger Delta.

---

## What’s your motivation?

My motivation comes from seeing how digital insecurity can disrupt education, business, and governance in my community. I want to help build systems that protect people and institutions, create opportunities, and support the region’s progress. The chance to make technology safer and more accessible for the Niger Delta is what drives me.

---

## Why Concordia?

Concordia’s Information Systems Security program offers a curriculum that closely matches the needs of the Niger Delta, with a strong emphasis on practical problem-solving and applied research. The program structure allows me to focus on projects and technologies directly relevant to the challenges I want to address at home.

---

## Why Information Security?

Information security is fundamental to the safe adoption of technology in any society. Without it, digital initiatives in education, business, and governance are vulnerable to disruption and abuse. By specializing in this field, I can help ensure that the Niger Delta’s digital transformation is secure, inclusive, and sustainable.

---

## Why NDDC?

The NDDC’s mission to build local capacity and drive sustainable development in the Niger Delta aligns with my personal and professional goals. The scholarship is not just financial support—it is a partnership with an organization committed to transforming the region. I want to be part of that transformation, using my skills to address real needs and create lasting value for my community.
